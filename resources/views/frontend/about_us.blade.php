      <h3>About</h3>


<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://naisse.org/index.php/page?type=prophetic_food&amp;id=33&amp;info_id=279">NAISSE</a>
 is a pioneering portal showcasing this integrative, systematic and 
holistic approach using Naqli (revealed knowledge via Quran and the 
Prophet Rasullullah’s Sunnah) and Aqli (non-religious rational knowledge
 encompassing science, technology, arts, humanities and the social 
sciences). Our focus aims on the remedies for four common illnesses in 
the bottom billion of the world which is; gastroenteritis, worm 
infestation, anemia, and fatigue. Eleven teams were established in 
conducting the search of primary sources in the field of :<br><br>Quran and Hadith<br>Malay Manuscripts<br> Pharmacology, Scientific Systematic Reviews<br> Data Mining<br> Animal Nutrition<br> Economic Development<br> Human Gut Microbiology<br> Neurophysiology<br> Anemia, Pathology<br> Experimental Helminthology<br> Community Health <br> <br>These
 sources are then arranged systematically in the engine for researchers 
and individuals to view. For now, we have covered two main prophetic 
foods which are dates and goat’s milk. Other prophetic foods will be 
updated in the future as the system is consistently being updated for 
new information. <br><br> It is hoped that the search engine will be the
 global reference specializing in prophetic foods to assist in the 
efforts of countering the common illnesses of the bottom billion. <br> <br>
 The establishment of the search engine is the result of research by the
 Niche Research Grant Scheme team of Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia 
under the funding of Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia. </p>
